<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying error details**

I see that we need to fix an error, but the user hasn't specified what it is. I should ask for the exact error message and context. I can propose running the test script to help reproduce the issue. I could suggest the command `python backend_test.py`, keeping in mind that on Windows, it might be `py -3 backend_test.py`. If there's a ModuleNotFoundError, we can also install the requests library. Let's get that info first!
**Running the test script**

I need to provide a status update before executing the command to capture any errors from the test. First, I should change to the workspace path using the command `cd "C:\Users\srujan\OneDrive\Desktop\projects\7-Sem\Project Phase-1\Cursor\Blockchain"` and then run `py -3 backend_test.py`. If that fails due to the `py` command not being found, I can use `python` as a backup. I’ll create a PowerShell command to check for both and run the appropriate one. Let’s get this started!</details></think>

I'll reproduce the error by running your test script so I can see the exact failure and fix it. Now I'll run the backend test script from your project root.

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\srujan\OneDrive\Desktop\projects\7-Sem\Project Phase-1\Cursor\Blockchain"; if (Get-Command python -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) { python backend_test.py } elseif (Get-Command py -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) { py -3 backend_test.py } else { Write-Error "Python not found. Please install Python 3." } | cat
```

```
hain> cd "C:\Users\srujan\OneDrive\Desktop\projects\7-Sem\Project Phase-1\Cursor
\Blockchain"; if (Get-Command python -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) { python bac
kend_test.py } elseif (Get-Command py -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) { py -3 bac
kend_test.py } else { Write-Error "Python not found. Please install Python 3." }
 | cat

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving PowerShell issues**

I see I attempted to run a command with a pipe to cat, but that resulted in a PowerShell error due to an empty pipe. In Windows PowerShell, piping Write-Error to cat isn't valid, and using | cat isn't necessary here. I'll simplify and just run the command. If Python is available, I'll use py -3, but I can also run: python backend_test.py. I'll provide a status update before executing the call, then check for any actual HTTP errors. Let's get this going!</details></think>

Running the test script again without the invalid PowerShell pipe to capture the real error output.
